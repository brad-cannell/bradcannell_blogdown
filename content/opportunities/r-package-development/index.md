These are standalone R package development projects that are available for volunteers who want to gain experience with creating, publishing, and maintaining R packages. For each of these, the best place to start is probably by looking at the "issues" tab on GitHub.

## Current R packages under development

1. [freqtables](https://github.com/brad-cannell/freqtables)

    - The goal of freqtables is to quickly make tables of descriptive statistics for categorical variables (i.e., counts, percentages, confidence intervals). This package is designed to work in a tidyverse pipeline, and consideration has been given to get results from R to Microsoft Word ® with minimal pain.

2. [meantables](https://github.com/brad-cannell/meantables)

    - The goal of meantables is to quickly make tables of descriptive statistics (i.e., counts, means, confidence intervals) for continuous variables. This package is designed to work in a Tidyverse pipeline, and consideration has been given to get results from R to ‘Microsoft Word’ ® with minimal pain.

3. [cerebro](https://github.com/brad-cannell/cerebro)

    - The goal of cerebro is to find unique people (entities (mutants?)) in a dataset and assign them a unique ID.
