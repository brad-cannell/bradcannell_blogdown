These are teaching and training projects I need help developing and/or improving.

## Current opportunities available

1. [R4Epi book](https://www.r4epi.com/)

    - I always need help with fixing errors, updating, and adding content to my R for Epidemiology electronic textbook.

    - You can get an idea of what needs to be done by checking out the GitHub issues page.  Having said that, the issues page needs to be updated. Perhaps you can help with that too.
