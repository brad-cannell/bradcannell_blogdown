These are standalone data management and analysis projects that are available for volunteers who want to gain experience with real-world data. Some projects may also result in authorship on a publication.

## Current opportunities available

1. Merge DETECT data with APS data.

    - I'm looking for someone who can help me link records across two administrative datasets that don't share a unique identifier. Instead, we will need to probabilistically match people across datasets based on name, date of birth, and address. We will likely use R's [RecordLinkage package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RecordLinkage/index.html), R's [fastLink package](https://github.com/kosukeimai/fastLink), or Python's [dedupe library](https://dedupe.io/) to accomplish this.
