These are standalone dashboard projects that are available for volunteers who want to gain experience with real-world data. [Here is an example dashboard](https://brad-cannell.github.io/detect_recruitment_dashboard/). I need help building others like it. 

## Current opportunities available

1. [DETECT recruiting](https://brad-cannell.github.io/detect_recruitment_dashboard/)

    - I'm looking for someone to help me update and improve the dashboard linked above.

    - This dashboard needs to be updated to include data from a new recruiting source (M. Davis). 

    - The code for this dashboard also needs to be streamlined.

2. [DETECT data checks](https://github.com/brad-cannell/detect_shiny_dashboard)

    - I'm looking for someone to help me create a dashboard similar to [DETECT recruiting dashboard](https://brad-cannell.github.io/detect_recruitment_dashboard/). However, it will include follow-up interview data instead of recruitment data.
