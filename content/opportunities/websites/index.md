These are websites I need help creating, improving, and/or maintaining. Knowing HTML, CSS, and Javascript may be useful, but they are typically not necessary because I currently use R's [blogdown package](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) to create most of my websites -- including the one you are currently viewing.

## Current opportunities available

1. Detection of Elder Abuse Through Emergency Care Technicians (DETECT) project.

    - I need help with updating and improving the [public-facing DETECT website](https://github.com/brad-cannell/detect).

    - Website link: https://brad-cannell.github.io/detect/

    - Perhaps convert to using Blogdown [Academic Theme](https://wowchemy.com/hugo-themes/). Similar to the website you are currently viewing.
