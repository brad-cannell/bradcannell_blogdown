These are websites I need help creating, improving, and/or maintaining. Knowing HTML, CSS, and Javascript may be useful, but they are typically not necessary because I currently use R's [blogdown package](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) to create most of my websites -- including the one you are currently viewing.

## Current opportunities available

Nothing at this time. Please check back in the future.
