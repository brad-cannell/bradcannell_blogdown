Hello and welcome to Brad Cannell's guide for students. In this guide, you will find general advising information, currently available research opportunities, graduate assistantship opportunities, FAQs, and guidance for helping you complete common research-related tasks. I'm always looking for ways to improve this guide, so your constructive feedback is welcome and appreciated!
